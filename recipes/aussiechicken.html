    <h3>Recipe steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, corn syrup, mayonnaise and dried onion flakes. Remove half of sauce, cover and 
        <br>refrigerate to serve later.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the breasts in the skillet and saute for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned.
        <br> Remove from skillet and place the breasts into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Apply the honey mustard sauce to each breast, 
        <br>then layer each breast with mushrooms and bacon. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear. Garnish with parsley and serve with the 
        <br>reserved honey mustard sauce.</li>
